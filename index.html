<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>PyGarmin is a set of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>
classes which implement the protocol used by <a
href="http://www.garmin.com">Garmin</A> GPS receivers to talk to each
other and to other machines. It is based on the official <a
href="http://www.garmin.com/support/commProtocol.html">protocol
specification</a>.  PyGarmin is not a complete application - it is
just a toolkit to help you write applications.  I'm assuming you know
how to program in Python.</p>

<p>This is a project which is in development. Everything could change
dramatically, and probably will.  Some bits are not fully
implemented yet. Much of it is not really tested. No support. No
guarantees. And so forth.</p>

<p>Having said all of that, this does allow me to download information
from my GPS12XL to my Linux box, and it ought to adjust automatically
to a large number of different Garmin receivers.  If you use PyGarmin,
it will probably be much quicker than writing your own software from
scratch.  It has had limited testing on other models. If it works
on your GPS, let me know. If it doesn't, let me know.  The more info
you can give me about what went wrong, the more likely I am to fix
it.</p>

<p>If you want to cut straigh to the code go to the SourceForge
project page mentioned above. But I suggest you read on first.  The
code looks quites scary if you don't know what's happening!</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>Almost every model of Garmin receiver implements a slightly
different protocol. They have many things in common, but there are
minor differences. For example, some receivers can display icons, and
they therefore transmit waypoints which have an extra 'symbol' field,
not used in other models. Others don't use icons, but do store
altitude. And so forth. You need to get the protocol right for your
particular model.</p>

<p>This makes matters more complicated, but at least these things are
well documented by Garmin. The <a href="http://www.garmin.com/support/commProtocol.html">specification</a> includes a big table
which details, for each product type, what protocol it uses for basic
commands, what it uses for downloading waypoints, what it uses for
downloading routes, and so forth.</p>

<p>I have created Python classes for each of the protocols listed in
the spec, and for each of the data types. Well, most of them. The big
table becomes, in Python, a mapping from the Garmin product ID to the
set of relevant classes. This means that, while there are a large
number of classes defined in the source, only a few of them will ever
be used by any given receiver. The classes are all given names based
on those used in the specification, so look at that if you want to
know more about them.</p>

<p>The included class <tt>garmin.Garmin</tt> will connect to your GPS,
read its product ID and software version, and then look up the
appropriate classes in the table. It creates instances of the protocol
classes and notes the datatype classes for each type of data used in
the transmisisons. It also has some friendly methods like
'getWaypoints', which do what you would expect. But what you get back
when you call this is a list of objects, each of which is an instance
of a class derived from garmin.Waypoint, but the precise type of the
objects will depend on the GPS you're talking to.</p>

<p>OK. Here's a simple Python program:</p>
<center><table width=90% border=0 bgcolor="#ffeeff" cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td>
<i><font color="#804040">#! /usr/local/bin/python</font></i><br>
<i><font color="#804040"># Load the module</font></i><br>
<tt>import garmin</tt><br>
<br>
<i><font color="#804040"># Create a 'physical layer' connection using serial port</font></i><br>
<tt>phys = garmin.UnixSerialLink("/dev/ttyS0")</tt><br>
<br>
<i><font color="#804040"># Create a Garmin object using this connection</font></i><br>
<tt>gps = garmin.Garmin(phys)</tt><br>
<br>
<i><font color="#804040"># Get the waypoints from the GPS</font></i><br>
<i><font color="#804040"># (This may take a little while)</font></i><br>
<tt>waypoints = gps.getWaypoints()</tt><br>
<br>
<i><font color="#804040"># Print the waypoints</i></font><br>
<tt>for w in waypoints:</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print w.ident, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lat = garmin.degrees(w.slat)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lon = garmin.degrees(w.slon)<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print lat, lon, w.cmnt</tt><br>
</td></tr></table></center>

<p>Simple, eh?  This should work for almost any model, because all
waypoints will have an identity, a latitude &amp; longitude, and a
comment field. The latitude and longitude are stored in 'semicircle'
coordinates (basically degrees, but scaled to fill a signed long
integer), and so the fields are called 'slat' and 'slon'. The function
<tt>garmin.degrees()</tt> converts these to degrees.</p>

<h2>More details</h2>

<p>There are 3 levels of protocol documented:</p>
<center><table border=0 cellpadding=6 cellspacing=2>
<tr><td bgcolor="#ffffe0" align="center"><b>Application layer</b></td><td>(highest level)</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#e0ffff" align="center"><b>Link layer</b></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#e0ffe0" align="center"><b>Physical layer</b></td><td>(lowest level)</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>The specification documents the various different versions of these
under labels of Pxxx, Lxxx, Axxx etc, where xxx is a number, and this
convention is followed here. There are also various data types, named
Dxxx. Roughly speaking, the Physical protocols specify RS232, the Link
protocols specify a packet structure for sending messages to and fro,
and the Application protocols specify what can actually go in those
packets.</p> 

<p>For example, a Garmin GPS 38 will talk to your computer
over physical layer P000 (RS232) using a packet structure defined by
link layer L001.  If you want to transfer waypoints to and from it,
they will be sent using application layer A100 (a waypoint transfer
protocol), and the actual waypoints transferred will be of type
D100. </p>

<p>At the time of writing, the only documented physical layer is P000
which is roughly RS232 at 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop
bit. In the software, we model this as a P000 class that has read and
write methods, which can be used by the higher protocol levels. The
UnixSerialPort class used in the sample code above is a subtype of
P000.</p> 

<p>If you want to understand more, read the source and the specification. I may get round to more docs, when there's more to document.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>Things which may be fixed/finished. Volunteers welcome!</p>
<ul>

<li>Currently no real support for the A800/D800 real-time data protocol.  That means you can't currently use PyGarmin to handle live position data such as you'd get from NMEA. Actually, the classes are partly defined, but none of the products in the 'big table' use this protocol. I think A700 will do something similar if you repeatedly request the position from the host.</li>
 
<li>Some data type classes are not implemented here, just because I got bored of typing. I've done the ones used by the more common units, but if yours isn't covered, it should be easy to add. They're only a few lines each.</li>

<li>Not enough error reporting if things go wrong.  No timeouts if the GPS just isn't connected or isn't switched on, or isn't set to use Garmin mode on its interface.</li>

<li>More helpful methods to be added to the Garmin class.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Things I would like to do</h2>

<ul>

<li>We need a standard text-based file format to store all the data on
disk.  I suggest something XML-based.  That was the reason I started
writing this; so I could back up my waypoint & track data without
using somebody's proprietary format.</li>

<li>Some pretty applications.</li>

<li>This page could be improved.</li>

</ul>

who implemented many of the more
recent bits of the protocol, and so made PyGarmin useful for people
with newer GPS units than mine!</p>
